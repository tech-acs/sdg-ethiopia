2020,"City: Adama Nazreth; Only public transport stops which are mapped are included in the analysis which may include both formal and informal stops. Many cities have an informal network which is not fully mapped and may thus record higher levels of access to public transport than reported here; Data on public transport stops is sourced from city maps, OSM, GTFS, UITP, Google, and point mapping in some cities; Data used to estimate population with access to public transport is based on grid level population disaggregation directly from city/country data, HRSL (Facebook and CIESIN), WorldPop or GHS-Pop; City/urban area used in the analyis has been generated using a classification approach based on the Urban Extent or the Degree of Urbanization concepts to city definition.
